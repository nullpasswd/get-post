# GET/POST test server

This is a webserver made with [Sanic](https://sanic.dev/) that's used to test GET and POST requests with things like forms and the like.

## Quickstart

To get started, set the `action` method of your `<form>` tag to the URL of the API endpoint (_/api_), and set the method to either **GET** or **POST**. Other than using some spicy JavaScript magic (awesome) or your web browser (lame) to handle the data response, you're all set.
